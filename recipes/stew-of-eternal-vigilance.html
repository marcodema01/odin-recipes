    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Stew of Eternal Vigilance is less a meal and more a tactical fortification for the soul, radiating a deep, earthy aroma that smells of iron, woodsmoke, and ancient forests. It is a visually striking pottage, where the obsidian glint of black lentils and the deep, ink-like stain of a heavy stout create a dark "void" from which vibrant golden carrots and hearty chunks of seared meat emerge like islands in a midnight sea.</p>
    
    <h2>The Sacrifices Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Muscle of the great bear</li>
        <li>5 large carrots</li>
        <li>Black lentils</li>
        <li>1 large leek</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
        <li>1 liter of beef stock</li>
        <li>500 ml of black coffee</li>
        <li>One head of rosted garlic</li>
        <li>Horseradish</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Ritual of Creation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your heavy cast-iron pot upon the coals. Heat it until it hums. Toss in the meat and sear it until it is the color of scorched earth.</li>
        <li>Cast in the leeks and carrots. Let them soften, but do not let them break.</li>
        <li>Return the meat to the cauldron. Pour in the ale and the broth. As the foam rises, whisper the names of those you protect. Add the garlic, ginger, and the dried peas.</li>
        <li>Submerge your herbs. Cover the cauldron and move it to the edge of the fire. Let it simmer low and slow for three hours. The meat must become tender enough to yield, yet the broth must thicken into a rich, dark elixir.</li>
        <li>Before the sun sets, stir in the peppercorns and chili. This heat is not for comfort; it is to ensure the spirit does not grow weary.</li>
    </ol>
