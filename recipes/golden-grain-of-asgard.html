    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        <em>
            From the hallowed pages of The 
            Allfather’s Recipes
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>To honor the Wanderer at your table, 
        one must craft the Sun-Thread Bread, 
        known to the common folk as egg pasta. 
        It is a craft as old as the world-tree, 
        yet swifter than Sleipnir’s gallop once 
        you master the art. Many fear the labor, 
        but the Allfather knows that greatness 
        requires but a moment of true focus.</p>
    <h2>The Sacrifices Required</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Ritual of Creation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heap your flour. Use your fist to carve a deep well in the center, like the crater left by Mjolnir.</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs into the hollow. Take a fork—or your fingers, if you possess the courage—and whisk the eggs gently, being careful not to breach the floury walls too soon.</li>
        <li>Slowly, pull the inner walls of the flour into the pool. Mix until a shaggy, chaotic mass forms. This is the primordial state of Ginnungagap.</li>
        <li>Now, use your hands. Knead the dough with the fury of a storm.</li>
        <li>The dough must rest to find its peace.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough thin until you can see the grain of the wood beneath it, then slice it into ribbons or shapes of your choosing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The final ascendance</h2>
    <p>Drop the pasta into a cauldron of water, salted like the Great Ocean. Boil it for a mere 2 to 4 minutes. When it rises to the surface, it has ascended. Serve it with butter, herbs, or the spoils of your hunt.</p>
