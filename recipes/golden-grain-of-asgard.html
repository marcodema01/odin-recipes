        <em>
            From the hallowed pages of The 
            Allfather’s Recipes

    </p>
    <p>To honor the Wanderer at your table, 
        one must craft the Sun-Thread Bread, 
        known to the common folk as egg pasta. 
        It is a craft as old as the world-tree, 
        yet swifter than Sleipnir’s gallop once 
        you master the art. Many fear the labor, 
        but the Allfather knows that greatness 
        requires but a moment of true focus.</p>
